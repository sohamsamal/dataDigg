For millennia trade had flourished within traditional societies, strictly confined in its economic and moral reach. Yet in the sixteenth century, commerce had moved in bold new directions. More effective ways to raise food slowly started to release workers and money for other economic pursuits, tobacco, cotton, tea, and silks that came to Europe from the East and West Indies and beyond. These improvements raised the standard of living for Western Europeans, but it took something more dramatic to break through the restraints of habit and authority of the old economic order. That world reshaping force came when a group of natural philosophers gained an understanding of physical laws. With this knowledge, investors with a more practical bent found stunning ways to generate energy from natural forces. Production took a quantum leap forward. Capitalism - a system based on individual investments on the production of marketable goods - slowly replaced the traditional ways of meeting the material needs of a society.
